# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xz: The Xz package contains programs for compressing and decompressing
xz: files. It provides capabilities for the lzma and the newer xz
xz: compression formats. Compressing text files with xz yields a better
xz: compression percentage than with the traditional gzip or bzip2
xz: commands.
