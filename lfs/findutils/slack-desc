# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

findutils: The Findutils package contains programs to find files. These programs
findutils: are provided to recursively search through a directory tree and to
findutils: create, maintain, and search a database (often faster than the
findutils: recusive find, but unreliable if the database has not been recently
findutils: updated).
